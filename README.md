# Titanic Model Notebook

This project explores the **Titanic dataset** to build a machine learning model that predicts passenger survival. The notebook walks through the typical data science pipeline: data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `titanic_model.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis and model training.

## ⚙️ Requirements
Make sure you have the following installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter matplotlib seaborn
```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install the dependencies.
3. Run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook titanic_model.ipynb
```

4. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Load and explore the Titanic dataset
   - Preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.)
   - Train a **Logistic Regression model**
   - Evaluate performance with metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix

## 📊 Features
- Data cleaning with **pandas** and **numpy**
- Machine learning with **scikit-learn**
- Model: **Logistic Regression**
- Evaluation on train/test split

## 🏆 Goal
The goal is to achieve a predictive model that determines whether a passenger survived based on features such as:
- Passenger class
- Sex
- Age
- Fare
- Embarked location

## 📌 Notes
- The dataset can be obtained from [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
- This is an introductory ML project to demonstrate classification basics.
